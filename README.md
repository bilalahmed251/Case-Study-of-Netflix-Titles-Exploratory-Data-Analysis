# Case-Study-of-Netflix-Titles-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix Titles dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to uncover insightful trends and patterns regarding Netflix’s content library, focusing on the distribution between Movies and TV Shows, content durations, release year trends, and feature correlations.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing values in critical columns such as `director`, `cast`, and `duration`.  
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure accuracy of analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed the count of Movies versus TV Shows to understand content composition.  
- Studied the distribution of movie durations with box plots highlighting central tendency and outliers.  
- Examined trends over the years with scatter plots to observe changes in release patterns.  
- Created a heatmap to explore correlations between numerical features.

### 3. Visualization
- Generated clear, insightful visualizations to support the findings, including bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Key Findings
- Movies constitute the majority of Netflix’s content, but TV Shows are increasing steadily.  
- Most movies fall within a standard duration range with some notable outliers.  
- Release year analysis revealed spikes indicating strategic content releases during certain years.  
- Correlation heatmap provided insights into relationships between variables, useful for further predictive analysis.

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights using Python-based data analysis tools. It highlights the importance of data cleaning, exploration, and visualization in making informed decisions.
